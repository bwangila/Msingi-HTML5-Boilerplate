# Martian Boilerplate

Martian boilerplate is a derivative of the [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate](HTML5 Boilerplate) that has been streamlined to the way we code at Skyline Design.

The main objective of this project is to allow you to dive into a website design without worrying about setting up the basics. Also, it lets us have a standard way of coding such that any Martian dev can jump into any project and pick up from where the other left. Smiles all round :-)
